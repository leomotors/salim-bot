# Salim Discord Bot V3

*Note: Salim Bot V3 is currently under progress, some features in V1 or V2 may be dropped*

**Fun Fact**: This is my *most active* project on GitHub

V1 and V2 didn't gone because it's riskyness. Just that I rewritten it to improve overall maintainability.

## Legacy Salim Bot

- 2.2.431 [Last of V2](https://github.com/Leomotors/Salim-Bot/tree/52ec1163deec606aaeed0a6cd6968815edd3f94c) (Before implementing newly written [s-bot-framework](https://github.com/Leomotors/s-bot-framework))
